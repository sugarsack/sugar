# States library setup.
# States are YAML files with .st extension each.
# There is no global default state that would be called
# in any case, once nothing at all is specified. State system
# is working by calling implicitly either "init.st" in directory,
# or directly a file.
#
# For example, "foo.bar" might be "ROOT/foo/bar.st", or it might
# be also "ROOT/foo/bar/init.st" as co-called package.
#
# However, state system supports aliases or shortcuts to a long URIs
# of some paths to avoid long typing. Each alias has prefix of the
# environment name, delimited by a colon. For example, to alias "foo.bar"
# from the "special" environment, it is written as "special:foo.bar".
