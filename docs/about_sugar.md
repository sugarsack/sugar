# About Sugar in the Sack

## Why?

Because sometimes things just has to be done.

Sugar is a distributed and event driven systems management tool prototype. 
Its main goal is to take care of next generation infrastructure layouts 
that contains microservices and immutable systems. Its closest sibling
that looks and feels almost the same would be Salt from SaltStack. However
there are (or will be) major differences by design, involving the way
modules are working and distributed, it is event-driven from the ground,
multi-master networking in various topoligies including HA, automatic
clustering etc.

It is not yet ready for anything meaningful as project started from scratch
on December 2018 and it certainly isn't a full time coding job.

Get involved today!

## What?

It depends. Also on you. Generally, configuration management is _very hard
thing to do_ if you want to get it right. The more you are into the topic
and its depth, the worse and more difficult it gets.

And so the idea of this project is a bit different: **you make it as you want**.
Where and how Sugar will be in your infrastructure: it all would depend only
on community.

## When?

If you won't join today and won't start submitting your pull requests, then
it will be longer! :-)
