# What is Sugar Project?

Sugar Project is a software for complex systems management at scale.

The goal of the project is to be easy enough to get it running in minutes,
be scalable and fast enough to manage well thousands of servers.

Sugar is heavily inspired by Salt Open project, developed by SaltStack.
But Sugar Project takes a whole new fresh look on the architecture and
design, focusing rather on modern intrastructure trends.

Same as Salt Open, Sugar Project can be used for data-driven orchestration,
remote execution for any infrastructure, configuration management for any
app stack, and much more.

## What is the status?

As of January 2019, Sugar Project is in its very early stage, ready for
nothing much. Stay tuned for the first release of it!
