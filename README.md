# What is Sugar Project?

Sugar Project is a **software prototype** for deploying complex systems management at scale.

The goal of the project is to be easy enough to get it running in minutes,
be scalable and fast enough to manage well thousands of servers.

Sugar is heavily inspired by Salt Open project, developed by SaltStack.
But Sugar Project takes a whole new fresh look on the architecture and
design, focusing rather on modern intrastructure trends.

Same as Salt Open, Sugar Project can be used for data-driven orchestration,
remote execution for any infrastructure, configuration management for any
app stack, and much more.

## What is the motto?

No matter how slow it goes. As long as it doesn't stop.

## What is the status?

Something works already: 

- server/client registration
- keys management
- client machines matching by complex queries
- state compiler (still needs a better way tracing failed state files)
- module loader
- Sugar SDK for developing modules (yay!). It gets installed along, if you setup dev-env.
- i18n!!! :wink:

As of January 2019, Sugar Project is in its very early stage, ready for
nothing much. Stay tuned for the first release of it!

## How far it will go?

No intention. It is a prototype for research and ideas. If it will grow
up, then it will only show that it is needed. If not, then this project
will stay for purely academic reasons.
